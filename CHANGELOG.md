- Allow simulcast to be enabled, but default to off. It now works, but savings
  aren't as high as originally thought. It may still be helpful to enable for
  low-resource clients, but it means that they may stop sending or receiving
  video if their CPU or connection cannot handle all of the streams.
- Set a default video encoding that saves some resources but still looks good
  based on configured resolution

  help for users with limited CPU or bandwidth
